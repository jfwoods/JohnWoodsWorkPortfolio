# Design

## Revision 1
Knowing pretty much nothing about designing circuit boards, this revision was a little... interesting. I only choose to include it here to show how the design started and how I learned more about the process from this first step. I am much more proud of revision 2. 

![Revision 1 Motherboard](./PCBpics/rev1empty.jpg/ "This is the revision 1 motherboard. The 10 pin through hole connector at the top is for connecting either a HAM module or RockBlock 9603.")

![Revision 1 HAM Module](./PCBpics/hamr1empty.jpg/ "This is the revision 1 HAM module. This board includes a level shifter for communicating with the motherboard, as well as a low pass filter for the antenna signal.")

These first boards were definitely a step in the right direction, but they needed some work. The level shifter wound up being near impossible for me to solder correctly, so I knew Rev. 2 would use a larger form factor of the same component. The motherboard was also poorly laid out and the traces were far too narrow for the current they were carrying.
