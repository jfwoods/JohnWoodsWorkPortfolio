# Balloon Tracking Research Project
This project began back in April 2023, when I was a student in Dr. Ridley's Engineering 100 - Weather Balloons class at UMich. We spent the semester designing and building custom circuit boards to act as a weather balloon payload with various sensors, a microcontroller, GPS, and SD card module to record the data.

Come launch time, and the balloons launch! Only to lose communication with the tracking system. The next couple days were a little hectic, as we had no idea where our payloads had gone. We knew this was a possibility, but it saddened the class nontheless. Fortuneately, both balloons launched had crashed into fields in southeast Michigan, and were recovered by the landowners and returned to us. This was when work on the next-gen tracking system began.

When we first sat down to begin planning, we came up with these goals:
- Custom design with documentation
- Use redundant methods of communication
- Use a microcontroller board (i.e. Arduino, Teensy, RP2040, etc.) as the brains
- 3+ hour battery life in cold conditions
- Ideally record all GPS data for post-flight analysis
- Light, reliable, and rugged (all simple requirements for a project like this)
