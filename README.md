## INTRODUCTION
    Hello! My name is John Woods and I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I created this repo as a place to showcase some of my design work. Outside of classes, research, and passion projects, I am also the Drivetrain Director for MRacing, Michigan's Formula Student team. If you're interested in the work MRacing does, please visit our [website](https://www.mracing.engin.umich.edu/) for more information.

### Weather Balloon Tracking Project
    Towards the end of my freshman year, an opportunity arose to spend the summer as a research assistant for Dr. Aaron Ridley, developing a new custom tracking solution for his introductory weather balloon class. This sent me headfirst into the world of PCB design and embedded systems. The system is still a work in progress, but initial testing has been successful and the design is in a complete state. For more information on this project, check out the weather balloon page.
